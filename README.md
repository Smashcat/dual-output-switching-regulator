# dual-output-switching-regulator
Small board with single 8-26v input and 5V@1.7A + 3.3V@500mA dual output via switching regulator

This board uses the cheap BD93291EFJ switching buck regulator which offers dual output, and is much more efficient than using linear regulators, while also allowing for higher input voltages than typical linear regulators; up to 26V. The board is very small - just 21mm x 30mm, so you can have 20 made at JLCPCB for under $1 :) Pin pitches are all quite large for surface mount, so a stencil isn't necessary to solder this board.

The pin headers are 2.54mm pitch, as the board is designed to be plugged into a breadboard as a convenient dual-rail power supply.
